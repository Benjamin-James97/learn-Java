# OOPS
**Object oriented programing -creation of objects which contains both the methods and data.**

## Benefits :
- Simple and faster execution.
- Maintains proper structure in code.
- Helps to keep the code DRY("Don't Repeat Yourself"), easily maintainable and debuggable.

## Classes & Objects:
- Classes are templates for objects and Objects are instances of classes.

## Non-Access Modifiers
- Transient -To skip members and methods from serialization.
- sychronised -To make it thread-safe, only one thread can access at a time.
- volatile -To skip local-thread cache and read from main memory.

## Encapsulation
To hide sensitive data from users. Can be done using the `private` access modifier.
### Benefits :
- Have better control over data.
- Class attributes can be made read-only or write-only.
- Increased security for data.
